       "  \"Each player is given $1,500 divided as follows: P each of $500s, \\n$100~ and $50~; 6 $40~; 5 each of $105, $5~ and $Is. \\nAll remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank. Stack the .. \\nBank's money on edge in the compartments in the plastic Banker's tray. \\nBANKER. Select as Banker a player who will also \\nmake a good Auctioneer A Banker who plays \\n~n the game must keep hislher personal funds \\nseparate from those of the Bank. When more than \\nf~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only \\nas Banker and Auctioneer. \\nTHE BANK: Besides the Bank's money, the Bank \\nholds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase \\nand use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells \\nand auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards;\",\n",

Retaining the dice, throw again and move \\nyour token as before. If you throw doubles three times in succession, \\nmove your token immediately to the space marked \"In Jail\" (see JAIL).',\n",

However, if a player passing GO on \\nthe throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it \\non Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond \\nit on Chance, and draws the \"Advance to GO\" card, helshe collects \\n$200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the \\nsecond time by instructions on the card. \\nBUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you \\nmay buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the \\nTitle Deed card showing ownership; place it faceup in front of you. \\nIf you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction',\n",

Blastenkrise bei chronischer myeloischer Leukämie [CML] C95.8! Leukämie, refraktär auf Standard-Induktionstherapie C97! Bösartige Neubildungen als Primärtumore an mehreren Lokalisationen Hinweise: 1.Primäre, ungenau bezeichnete, sekundäre und nicht näher bezeichnete Lokalisationen bösartiger Neubildungen Die Kategorien C76-C80 umfassen bösartige Neubildungen, bei denen keine eindeutige Angabe über deren Ursprungsort  vorliegt,  oder  Neubildungen  ohne  Angabe  des  Ursprungsortes,  die  als  \"disseminiert\", \"ausgebreitet\"  oder  \"ausgedehnt\"  bezeichnet  sind.  In  diesen  Fällen  wird  der  Ursprungsort  als  unbekannt angesehen. 2.Funktionelle Aktivität In diesem Kapitel sind sämtliche Neubildungen klassifiziert, ungeachtet dessen, ob sie funktionell aktiv sind oder  nicht.  Mit  einer  zusätzlichen  Schlüsselnummer  aus  Kapitel  IV  kann  eine  mit  einer  Neubildung zusammenhängende  funktionelle  Aktivität  angegeben  werden.  So  erhält  z.B.  ein  katecholaminbildendes bösartiges Phäochromozytom der Nebenniere die Schlüsselnummer C74 und die zusätzliche Schlüsselnummer E27.5; ein basophiles Adenom der Hypophyse mit Cushing-Syndrom erhält die Schlüsselnummer D35.2 und die zusätzliche Schlüsselnummer E24.0. 65 ICD-10-GM Version 2025 3.Morphologie Die bösartigen Neubildungen lassen sich in mehrere morphologische (histologische) Hauptgruppen unterteilen: Karzinome,  einschließlich  Plattenepithel-  und  Adenokarzinomen,  Sarkome,  andere  Weichteiltumoren, einschließlich  Mesotheliomen,  Lymphome  (Hodgkin-  und  Non-Hodgkin-),  Leukämien,  sonstige  näher bezeichnete  und  lokalisationsspezifische  Arten  sowie  nicht  näher  bezeichnete  Krebsarten.  Krebs  ist  ein Oberbegriff  für  alle  genannten  Gruppen,  der  allerdings  selten  für  die  bösartigen  Neubildungen  des lymphatischen,  blutbildenden  und  verwandten  Gewebes  benutzt  wird.  Die  Bezeichnung  \"Karzinom\"  wird manchmal unkorrekterweise als Synonym für \"Krebs\" verwendet. Im vorliegenden Kapitel II erfolgt die Klassifizierung der Neubildungen innerhalb großer Gruppen nach dem (biologischen bzw. biotischen) Verhalten, innerhalb dieser Gruppen hauptsächlich nach der Lokalisation. In einigen Ausnahmefällen wird die Morphologie in der Kategorien- und Subkategorien-Überschrift angegeben. Für  jene  Benutzer,  die  den  histologischen  Typ  von  Neubildungen  erfassen  wollen,  wird  auf  die  aktuelle Morphologie-Klassifikation  (ICD-O-3)  verwiesen,  die  zum  Download  auf  den  Webseiten  des  BfArM  zur Verfügung steht. Die bisher in der ICD-10 aufgeführten Morphologieschlüsselnummern, abgeleitet aus der 2. Ausgabe der Internationalen Klassifikation der Krankheiten für die Onkologie (ICD-O), waren nicht mehr aktuell. Die  ICD-O  ist  eine  zweiachsige  Klassifikation mit  je  einem  eigenständigen Kodiersystem  für die Topographie und für die Morphologie. Die Morphologieschlüsselnummern sind sechsstellig, die ersten vier Stellen kennzeichnen den histologischen Typ, die fünfte Stelle gibt das Verhalten (Malignitätsgrad) an (bösartig primär, bösartig sekundär (metastatisch), in situ, gutartig, ungewiss, ob bösartig oder gutartig), und die sechste Stelle  ist  ein Schlüssel  für die  Einstufung des Differenzierungsgrades von soliden Tumoren, der auch als spezieller Schlüssel für Lymphome und Leukämien benutzt wird. 4.Verwendung von Subkategorien in Kapitel II Es  soll  auf  die  spezielle  Verwendung  der  Subkategorie  .8  in  diesem  Kapitel  hingewiesen  werden  [siehe Hinweis  5.]. Wo Subkategorien für \"sonstige\" erforderlich waren, wurden diese generell mit Subkategorie  .7 bezeichnet. 5.Bösartige Neubildungen mit Überlappung der Lokalisationsgrenzen und Verwendung der Subkategorie  .8 (mehrere Teilbereiche überlappend) In den Kategorien C00-C75 sind primäre bösartige Neubildungen nach ihrem Ursprungsort klassifiziert. Viele dreistellige Kategorien sind außerdem nach aufgeführten Teilbereichen oder Subkategorien des betreffenden Organs unterteilt. Eine  Neubildung, die  zwei  oder mehr aneinandergrenzende  Teilbereiche  innerhalb einer dreistelligen Kategorie überlappt und deren Ursprungsort nicht bestimmt werden kann, sollte entsprechend der Subkategorie  .8 (\"mehrere Teilbereiche überlappend\") klassifiziert werden, vorausgesetzt, dass die Kombination nicht speziell an anderer Stelle aufgeführt ist. Karzinom der Speiseröhre und des Magens wird beispielsweise speziell mit C16.0 (Kardia) klassifiziert, während Karzinom der Spitze und der Ventralfläche der Zunge mit'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ICD.csv', 'row': 813}, page_content='Code: C02.8\\nDescription: verschlüsselt werden sollte. Andererseits sollte Karzinom der Zungenspitze mit Ausdehnung auf die Ventralfläche  mit  C02.1  verschlüsselt  werden,  da  der  Ursprungsort,  die  Zungenspitze,  bekannt  ist. \"Überlappend\"  bedeutet,  dass  die  beteiligten  Teilbereiche  aneinandergrenzen.  Obwohl  numerisch aufeinanderfolgende Subkategorien häufig auch anatomisch aneinandergrenzen, ist dies jedoch nicht immer der Fall  (z.B.  Harnblase  C67.-),  so  dass  der  Kodierer  bei  der  Festlegung  der  topographischen  Beziehungen möglicherweise auf anatomische Lehrbücher zurückgreifen muss. Manchmal liegt eine Überlappung über die Grenzen der dreistelligen Kategorien innerhalb bestimmter Systeme vor; um dem Rechnung zu tragen, sind die folgenden Subkategorien vorgesehen:'),\n",

Bei der Klassifizierung von Neubildungen muss zunächst immer der Eintrag im Alphabetischen Verzeichnis nachgeschlagen werden, um die morphologische Bezeichnung zu erhalten. In der Einführung zum Alphabetischen Verzeichnis werden allgemeine Hinweise zum richtigen Gebrauch des Alphabetischen Verzeichnisses gegeben. Die genaueren Anleitungen und Beispiele zu Neubildungen sollten berücksichtigt werden, um die Kategorien und Subkategorien des Kapitels II richtig zu benutzen. 8.Benutzung der Internationalen Klassifikation der Krankheiten für die Onkologie (ICD-O) Für  bestimmte  morphologische  Typen  bietet  das  Kapitel  II  eine  recht  begrenzte  oder  überhaupt  keine topographische  Klassifikation.  Der  Topographie-Schlüssel  der  ICD-O  verwendet  für  alle  Neubildungen  im Wesentlichen die gleichen drei- und vierstelligen Kategorien wie das Kapitel II für bösartige Neubildungen (C00-C77, C80); dadurch wird eine genauere Verschlüsselung der Lokalisation anderer Neubildungen (bösartige sekundäre (metastatische), gutartige, in situ und ungewisse oder unbekannte) möglich. Wer  sowohl  die  Lokalisation  als  auch  die  Morphologie  von  Tumoren  angeben  will,  z.B.  Krebsregister, onkologische Krankenhäuser, Pathologie-Abteilungen und andere Einrichtungen, die sich mit Krebs befassen, dem wird daher empfohlen, die ICD-O zu benutzen. 67 ICD-10-GM Version 2025 Bösartige Neubildungen (C00-C97) Bösartige Neubildungen an genau bezeichneten Lokalisationen, als primär festgestellt oder vermutet, ausgenommen lymphatisches, blutbildendes und verwandtes Gewebe (C00-C75) Bösartige Neubildungen der Lippe, der Mundhöhle und des Pharynx (C00-C14)'),\n",
