Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.
Some popular AI methods include machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

Multi-agent systems consist of multiple interacting intelligent agents. These systems can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent.
Agents can have different roles, capabilities, and knowledge, and they can work together to achieve a common goal.
